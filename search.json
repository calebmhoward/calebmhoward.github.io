    "section": "",
    "text": "For decades, the triple-double was seen as a rare feat to obtain in the NBA. A triple-double is getting double-digit totals in three different statistics, most commonly points, rebounds and assists. Then Russell Westbrook came in and turned this rarity into the norm.\nThe guard’s pursuit to stuff the stat sheet night after night changed the way that fans and players of the sport view the once-rare accomplishment. Westbrook didn’t just break records, he changed our expectations of what was possible.\nIn the 2016-17 season, Westbrook did what many thought was impossible. He broke Oscar Robertson’s 55-year record of the most triple-doubles in one season. The Oklahoma City player recorded 42 triple-doubles in the season, beating Robertson’s record by one.\nOn top of that, Westbrook averaged a triple-double for the season, becoming just the second player to do so. Even more, he averaged a triple-double for two more straight years on the Thunder and again in 2020-21 with the Wizards.\nThese amazing feats showed how one player could change the game. Every night, fans started expecting him to record a triple-double.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_stats_1976_2025.csv\")\n\nwest &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook\") \n\nwest_2017 &lt;- west |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2017\")\n\nwest |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = west, aes(x = Season, y = `Trp-Dbl`), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_col(data = west_2017, aes(x = Season, y = `Trp-Dbl`), fill = \"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 41, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2010, y=42.5, label=\"Oscar Robertson - 41\"), size = 3) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Triple-doubles\", \n    title=\"Breaking the Single-Season Triple-Double Record\",\n    subtitle=\"Russell Westbrook's historic 2016-17 season highlited among his career triple-double totals.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thought that Robertson’s career 181 triple-doubles would never be surpassed. For Russell Westbrook, that wasn’t something that he ever really thought of passing. Likewise, the rest of the top five leaders in triple-doubles, who are all some of the NBA’s greatest players.\nIn his first six seasons in the league, Westbrook amassed only eight triple-doubles. The next two seasons, he combined for 29 triple-doubles. Then came the 2016-17 season where he was the lone star of the Thunder.\nWestbrook didn’t just pass these basketball legends, he flew past their records at a fast pace. From 2015-2021, Westbrook recorded 165 triple-doubles. This span in his career would have made him an all-time great if that was his whole career.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_stats_1976_2025.csv\")\n\nwestbrook &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(career_td = sum(`Trp-Dbl`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Cumulative_TDs = cumsum(career_td))\n\nggplot(westbrook, aes(x = Season, y = Cumulative_TDs)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#007AC1\", size = 1) +   \n  geom_point(color = \"#007AC1\", size = 3) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 181, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 138, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 122, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 78, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 59, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2025, y=195, label=\"207\"), size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=188, label=\"Oscar Robertson - 181\"), size = 3.5) +     geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=145, label=\"Magic Johnson - 138\"), size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=129, label=\"Jason Kidd - 122\"), size = 3.5) +       geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=85, label=\"Wilt Chamberlain - 78\"), size = 3.5) +   geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=66, label=\"Larry Bird - 59\"), size = 3.5) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Triple-doubles\", \n    title=\"Westbrook's Quick Rise to the Top\", \n    subtitle=\"How Russell Westbrook passed NBA legends to become the all-time triple-double leader.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the start of the century, the NBA was averaging around 50 triple-doubles per season. After Russell Westbrook’s historic 2016-17 season, league-wide triple-doubles jumped. After Westbrook’s record year, the NBA was seeing double the triple-doubles per year and more.\nThe huge increase suggests that his play style changed the way that other players played basketball. His success with the stat showed the value in filling the stat sheet each game.\nDuring his five-year peak, Westbrook accounted for nearly 20-30% of all triple-doubles in the league. This was a massive percentage for only one player in the NBA.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_stats_1976_2025.csv\")\n\nlast25 &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt;= 2000) |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(nba_tds = sum(`Trp-Dbl`, na.rm=TRUE))\n  \nwestbrook &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(westbrook_tds = sum(`Trp-Dbl`, na.rm=TRUE)) \n\ntot_nba_tds &lt;- last25 |&gt; \n  select(Season, nba_tds) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(nba_tds),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"tds\"\n  )\n \ntot_west_tds &lt;- westbrook |&gt; \n  select(Season, westbrook_tds) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(westbrook_tds),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"tds\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=tot_nba_tds, aes(x=Season, weight=tds, fill= \"NBA\")) +\n  geom_bar(data=tot_west_tds, aes(x=Season, weight=tds, fill= \"Westbrook\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"lightgrey\", \"#007AC1\"), name=\"\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Triple-doubles\", \n    title=\"Westbrook's Impact on League Triple-Doubles\", \n    subtitle=\"Comparing Russell Westbrook's triple-doubles per season to the rest of the nba since 2000.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestbrook became the all-time triple-double leader as a point guard. He popularized playing out of position in the league. His versatility grabbing rebounds and dishing assists changed the way other positions were played. Big men started working on their passing and playing more away from the basket.\nWestbrook was heavily criticized by the media for chasing stats for himself instead of team wins. But this criticism showed how he changed things. The triple-double started to lose value and become common enough for people to debate its value.\nBy turning the triple-double into a common occurrence, Westbrook made his achievements both special and less special. Special for how many triple-doubles he got at such a fast rate, but less special for how much more common they were becoming.\nHe forever changed what we know about triple-doubles and how he normalized them."
