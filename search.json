    "title": "Which Premier League Big Six teams are the most clinical finishers?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Football is a game of moments. While creating chances is key, converting those opportunities into goals often separates champions from contenders. The Premier League’s “Big Six” teams are Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, and Tottenham. These six have dominated the Premier League since the start, but which of these top clubs makes the most of their scoring opportunities?\nLooking at the past five seasons (2020-2025), clear patterns emerge in how these teams perform in relation to their expected goals. Expected goals (xG) measures the quality of chances created based on factors like shot location, angle, and defensive pressure. By comparing xG to actual goals, we can find out which teams are clinical finishers and which squads waste chances.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggalt) \nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nprem_data &lt;- read_csv(\"premseasons.csv\")\n\nbig_six &lt;- c(\"Manchester Utd\", \"Manchester City\", \"Liverpool\", \"Chelsea\", \"Arsenal\", \"Tottenham\")\n\nlast_five_seasons &lt;- c(\"2020-2021\", \"2021-2022\", \"2022-2023\", \"2023-2024\", \"2024-2025\")\n\nbig_six_data &lt;- prem_data |&gt; \n  filter(Squad %in% big_six)  |&gt; \n  filter(Season %in% last_five_seasons)  |&gt; \n  group_by(Squad) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Total_Goals = sum(Gls),\n    Total_xG = sum(xG_Expected),\n    Efficiency = Total_Goals / Total_xG\n  ) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(Efficiency))\n\nbig_six_data |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    Total_Goals = \"Goals\",\n    Total_xG = \"xG\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Premier League Big Six Finishing Efficiency\",\n    subtitle = \"Manchester City leads in chances created, but who's most clinical at finishing?\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Caleb Howard  |  **Source:** FBref\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     ) \n   )  |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"#6caddf\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Squad == \"Manchester City\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPremier League Big Six Finishing Efficiency\n\n\nManchester City leads in chances created, but who's most clinical at finishing?\n\n\nSquad\nGoals\nxG\nEfficiency\n\n\n\n\nManchester City\n429\n377.2\n1.1373277\n\n\nTottenham\n325\n294.3\n1.1043153\n\n\nArsenal\n344\n312.9\n1.0993928\n\n\nLiverpool\n389\n389.9\n0.9976917\n\n\nManchester Utd\n276\n285.8\n0.9657103\n\n\nChelsea\n301\n311.9\n0.9650529\n\n\n\nBy: Caleb Howard | Source: FBref\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester City leads in chance creation, generating a lot of high-quality chances. Their dominance in possession translates to sustained attacking pressure. This results in both high expected and actual goals. Tottenham and Arsenal follow closely behind, creating just as dangerous chances through their attack.\n\n\nCode\nbig_six_combined &lt;- prem_data |&gt; \n  filter(Squad %in% big_six) |&gt; \n  filter(Season %in% last_five_seasons) |&gt; \n  group_by(Squad) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Total_Goals = sum(Gls),\n    Total_xG = sum(xG_Expected)\n  )\n\nggplot(big_six_combined, aes(x = Total_xG, y = Total_Goals, color = Squad)) +\n  geom_point(size = 5) +\n  geom_abline(linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#ef0107\", \"#034694\", \"#dd0000\", \"#6caddf\", \"#740703\", \"#132257\" )) +\n  \n  labs(\n    x=\"xG\", \n    y=\"Goals\", \n    title=\"Creating and Converting Chances\", \n    subtitle=\"Teams above the diagonal line scored more goals than expected.\", \n    caption=\"Source: FBref | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeams like Manchester City have managed to outperform their expected goals constantly. This shows great clinical goal scorers who convert difficult chances at rates more than what is expected of them.\nAs well, some traditionally strong attacking teams have underperformed their xG. This suggests that either bad finishing or maybe a run of bad luck that might eventually change over a longer period of time.\n\n\nCode\nbig_six_combined &lt;- prem_data |&gt;  \n  filter(Squad %in% big_six) |&gt; \n  filter(Season %in% last_five_seasons) |&gt; \n  group_by(Squad) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    Actual_Goals = sum(Gls),\n    Expected_Goals = sum(xG_Expected)\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(data = big_six_combined, aes(y = reorder(Squad, Actual_Goals), x = Expected_Goals, xend = Actual_Goals),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",  \n    colour_xend = \"red\" \n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"The Gap Between Expected and Actual Goals\", \n    subtitle = \"If &lt;span style='color:red;'&gt;Actual Goals&lt;/span&gt; are on the right of &lt;span style='color:blue;'&gt;Expected Goals&lt;/span&gt;, the team overperformed.\",\n    caption=\"Source: FBref | By Caleb Howard\",\n    x = \"Goals\",\n    y = \"\" \n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe efficiency gap between xGs and actual goals says something about each team’s style of play. Some like a lot of chances, while having average conversion rates. Others focus on less, higher-quality chances, relying on clinical goal scorers to get the job done.\nThis efficiency impacts the Premier League directly. Teams that consistently outperform their xG can get higher positions in the league than their chance creation might show, while wasteful teams may struggle to be dominate and get points.\nSuccess in the Premier League needs both creating quality chances and the clinical ability to convert them. Teams must balance both aspects to maximize their goal production and become the best."

    "title": "Did Russell Westbrook normalize the triple-double?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "For decades, the triple-double was seen as a rare feat to obtain in the NBA. A triple-double is getting double-digit totals in three different statistics, most commonly points, rebounds and assists. Then Russell Westbrook came in and turned this rarity into the norm.\nThe guard’s pursuit to stuff the stat sheet night after night changed the way that fans and players of the sport view the once-rare accomplishment. Westbrook didn’t just break records, he changed our expectations of what was possible.\nIn the 2016-17 season, Westbrook did what many thought was impossible. He broke Oscar Robertson’s 55-year record of the most triple-doubles in one season. The Oklahoma City player recorded 42 triple-doubles in the season, beating Robertson’s record by one.\nOn top of that, Westbrook averaged a triple-double for the season, becoming just the second player to do so. Even more, he averaged a triple-double for two more straight years on the Thunder and again in 2020-21 with the Wizards.\nThese amazing feats showed how one player could change the game. Every night, fans started expecting him to record a triple-double.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_stats_1976_2025.csv\")\n\nwest &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook\") \n\nwest_2017 &lt;- west |&gt; \n  filter(Season == \"2017\")\n\nwest |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(data = west, aes(x = Season, y = `Trp-Dbl`), fill = \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_col(data = west_2017, aes(x = Season, y = `Trp-Dbl`), fill = \"#007AC1\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 41, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2010, y=42.5, label=\"Oscar Robertson - 41\"), size = 3) +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Triple-doubles\", \n    title=\"Breaking the Single-Season Triple-Double Record\",\n    subtitle=\"Russell Westbrook's historic 2016-17 season highlited among his career triple-double totals.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMany thought that Robertson’s career 181 triple-doubles would never be surpassed. For Russell Westbrook, that wasn’t something that he ever really thought of passing. Likewise, the rest of the top five leaders in triple-doubles, who are all some of the NBA’s greatest players.\nIn his first six seasons in the league, Westbrook amassed only eight triple-doubles. The next two seasons, he combined for 29 triple-doubles. Then came the 2016-17 season where he was the lone star of the Thunder.\nWestbrook didn’t just pass these basketball legends, he flew past their records at a fast pace. From 2015-2021, Westbrook recorded 165 triple-doubles. This span in his career would have made him an all-time great if that was his whole career.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_stats_1976_2025.csv\")\n\nwestbrook &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(career_td = sum(`Trp-Dbl`)) |&gt; \n  mutate(Cumulative_TDs = cumsum(career_td))\n\nggplot(westbrook, aes(x = Season, y = Cumulative_TDs)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"#007AC1\", size = 1) +   \n  geom_point(color = \"#007AC1\", size = 3) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 181, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 138, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 122, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 78, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 59, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2025, y=195, label=\"207\"), size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=188, label=\"Oscar Robertson - 181\"), size = 3.5) +     geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=145, label=\"Magic Johnson - 138\"), size = 3.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=129, label=\"Jason Kidd - 122\"), size = 3.5) +       geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=85, label=\"Wilt Chamberlain - 78\"), size = 3.5) +   geom_text(aes(x=2011, y=66, label=\"Larry Bird - 59\"), size = 3.5) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Triple-doubles\", \n    title=\"Westbrook's Quick Rise to the Top\", \n    subtitle=\"How Russell Westbrook passed NBA legends to become the all-time triple-double leader.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the start of the century, the NBA was averaging around 50 triple-doubles per season. After Russell Westbrook’s historic 2016-17 season, league-wide triple-doubles jumped. After Westbrook’s record year, the NBA was seeing double the triple-doubles per year and more.\nThe huge increase suggests that his play style changed the way that other players played basketball. His success with the stat showed the value in filling the stat sheet each game.\nDuring his five-year peak, Westbrook accounted for nearly 20-30% of all triple-doubles in the league. This was a massive percentage for only one player in the NBA.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nstats &lt;- read_csv(\"nba_player_stats_1976_2025.csv\")\n\nlast25 &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Season &gt;= 2000) |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt;\n  summarize(nba_tds = sum(`Trp-Dbl`, na.rm=TRUE))\n  \nwestbrook &lt;- stats |&gt; \n  filter(Player == \"Russell Westbrook\") |&gt; \n  group_by(Season) |&gt; \n  summarize(westbrook_tds = sum(`Trp-Dbl`, na.rm=TRUE)) \n\ntot_nba_tds &lt;- last25 |&gt; \n  select(Season, nba_tds) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(nba_tds),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"tds\"\n  )\n \ntot_west_tds &lt;- westbrook |&gt; \n  select(Season, westbrook_tds) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(westbrook_tds),\n    names_to = \"Type\",\n    values_to = \"tds\"\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=tot_nba_tds, aes(x=Season, weight=tds, fill= \"NBA\")) +\n  geom_bar(data=tot_west_tds, aes(x=Season, weight=tds, fill= \"Westbrook\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"lightgrey\", \"#007AC1\"), name=\"\") +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Triple-doubles\", \n    title=\"Westbrook's Impact on League Triple-Doubles\", \n    subtitle=\"Comparing Russell Westbrook's triple-doubles per season to the rest of the nba since 2000.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Caleb Howard\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size= 10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWestbrook became the all-time triple-double leader as a point guard. He popularized playing out of position in the league. His versatility grabbing rebounds and dishing assists changed the way other positions were played. Big men started working on their passing and playing more away from the basket.\nWestbrook was heavily criticized by the media for chasing stats for himself instead of team wins. But this criticism showed how he changed things. The triple-double started to lose value and become common enough for people to debate its value.\nBy turning the triple-double into a common occurrence, Westbrook made his achievements both special and less special. Special for how many triple-doubles he got at such a fast rate, but less special for how much more common they were becoming.\nHe forever changed what we know about triple-doubles and how he normalized them."
